This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based planner specifically designed to optimize city tours for cruise passengers. By leveraging the power of DRL, the proposed planner aims to maximize the number of visited attractions while considering constraints such as time availability, attraction capacities, and travel distances. The planner offers an intelligent and personalized approach to city tour planning, enhancing the overall satisfaction of cruise passengers and minimizing the negative impacts on the city’s infrastructure.
